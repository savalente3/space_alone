# SpaceAlone

Space Alone is an RPG platform game. The RPG game was designed to emerge the gamer in space, while trying to survive in an apocalyptic circumstance. The character, Jake, is forced to leave earth after being invaded and destroyed by aliens. Jake's mission is to survive and find another planet to build a new community of humans. Along the way, Jake needs to collect resources and find other survivors to join him rebuild a human community.

For this projects C++ was the language used, along with the SFML library that allowed us to implement multimedia content in the game, such as backgrounds, characters and worlds.
